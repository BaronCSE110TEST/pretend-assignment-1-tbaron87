INSTRUCTIONS:
-You start at the purple node and are trying to get to the red node. If you see a lock, you will need to get all the keys to unlock it. (You can make multiple moves to do this, you don't need to get all of them in one go)
-On the left is the TOOLBOX. Four vectors are available. Each vector is linearly dependent with one other vector, and linearly dependent with the remaining two.
-On the top right is the EQUATION. Choose the vectors in the toolbox to construct the equation on the top right.
-You can modify the scalar multiples in the equation with the plus and minus buttons. The computed path of your vector is shown as a purple and a red line.
-Press "GO" to send the projectile to the destination following the path you've created.

CONTROLS:
-Mouse input to choose vectors and modify equation.
-Camera controls: Use the arrow keys to rotate the camera, and press "R" to reset the camera to its original position.
